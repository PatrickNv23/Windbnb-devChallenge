- Where can I see your demo?
  This frontend challenge was uploaded to the Netlify domains, because it is a very powerful service to upload your React projects to the internet.
- What was your experience?
  My experience at the end of this challenge has been satisfactory, because it made me review concepts that I had forgotten, it also helped me reinforce my knowledge of React such as React Context, state management, route management with React Router, etc.
  Lastly, I reinforced my knowledge of CSS grid using CSS modules and applying mobile responsive grids.
- What have you learned/improved?
  I had to brush up on the concepts of CSS modules and route handling with react router dom v6, plus I learned how to make modal windows with portal technology in React, which was a lot of fun.
